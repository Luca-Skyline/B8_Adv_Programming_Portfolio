## Complex Applications 3: Magic the Gathering Database
With this application, users can keep track of the Magic cards in their collection. They can create cards with a name, quantity, multiple card types, rarity, and legendaryness. New cards are appended to an Arraylist. They can then view, edit, and delete cards, as well as filter and view their collection based on card type. This last feature is recursive so you can filter down to specific combinations such as "artifact creatures".
